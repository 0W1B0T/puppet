.
.SH "NAME"
\fBpuppet\-queue\fR \- Deprecated queuing daemon for asynchronous storeconfigs
.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
Retrieves serialized storeconfigs records from a queue and processes them in order\. THIS FEATURE IS DEPRECATED; use PuppetDB instead\.
.
.SH "USAGE"
puppet queue [\-d|\-\-debug] [\-\-help] [\-v|\-\-verbose] [\-\-version]
.
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This application runs as a daemon and processes storeconfigs data, retrieving the data from a stomp server message queue and writing it to a database\. It was once necessary as a workaround for the poor performance of ActiveRecord\-based storeconfigs, but has been supplanted by the PuppetDB service, which gives better performance with less complexity\.
.
.P
For more information, see the PuppetDB documentation at http://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/puppetdb/latest
.
.SH "OPTIONS"
Note that any setting that\'s valid in the configuration file is also a valid long argument\. For example, \'server\' is a valid setting, so you can specify \'\-\-server \fIservername\fR\' as an argument\.
.
.P
See the configuration file documentation at http://docs\.puppetlabs\.com/references/stable/configuration\.html for the full list of acceptable parameters\. A commented list of all configuration options can also be generated by running puppet queue with \'\-\-genconfig\'\.
